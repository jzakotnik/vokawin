# VokaWin

> Realtime multiplayer vocabulary matching game for students

VokaWin is a free, open-source web application where 2–5 players compete to match vocabulary pairs as fast as possible. It is designed for German Gymnasium students practicing foreign language vocabulary.

## How It Works

1. A player selects a textbook, chooses a word range, and creates a game.
2. Other players join using a 5-letter game code or invite link.
3. After a 5-second countdown, all players see the same shuffled word pairs.
4. Players tap words to match source language with target language.
5. The first player to finish triggers a 30-second timer for others.
6. Points are awarded for correct matches; ties are broken by speed.
